# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization

## Project Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data to explore trends in cases, deaths, and vaccination progress across various countries. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization of key metrics such as total cases, deaths, and vaccination rates.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values, filters data for selected countries, and prepares the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Trends in total cases and deaths over time.
  - Comparison of daily new cases between countries.
  - Calculation and visualization of death rates.
- **Vaccination Progress**:
  - Cumulative vaccinations over time.
  - Percentage of vaccinated population by country.
- **Choropleth Map**:
  - Visualizes total cases and vaccination rates by country on a world map.
- **Insights and Reporting**:
  - Summarizes key findings and highlights anomalies or interesting patterns.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Python**: Core programming language used for analysis.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: Data manipulation and cleaning.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: Data visualization.
  - `plotly.express`: Interactive choropleth maps.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Combines code, visualizations, and narrative explanations.
